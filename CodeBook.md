# The Code Book
The purpose of this file is to describe the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data in reference.

In order to do so, it is mandatory to understand every aspect of the Data we are analysing, as shown below at *"Understanding the Data"* part. 

Worth noting that, although we describe the performed transformations/works done to clean up the data, we do it here as well. 

## 1. Understanding the Data

In any project or undertaking that involves data analysis, it is fundamental the understanding of the data collected/involved.
As mentioned at the `README.md` file, our data come from `UCI Machine Learning Repository Archives`, more specifically from the Databases Directory (folder nº 00240 - <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/>).

### 1.1 General Information

The data is regarding an experience on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.
This experience was performed by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz(1,2), Davide Anguita(1), Alessandro Ghio(1), Luca Oneto(1) and Xavier Parra(2)

**Abstract:** Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors 

### 1.2 The Downloaded Data

The Downloaded Data consists of a ZIP file named *UCI HAR Dataset.zip*, and its content is composed by a Data Set of twenty-eight (28) `TXT files` as listed below. In order to get this file list, you must first "open" the ZIP file. You can do this through the `unzip()` R command.
